User Server List
-------------------------

`draft` `optional`

Defines a replaceable event using `kind:10063` to advertise the blossom servers a user uses to host their blobs.

The event MUST include at least one `server` tag containing the full server URL including the `http://` or `https://`.

The order of these tags is important and should be arranged with the users most "reliable" or "trusted" servers coming first.

The `.content` is not used.

}
```

## Client Integration

When uploading blobs clients should attempt to upload the blob to all or at least the top 3 server on the list event.

This ensures that the blob is available in multiple locations in the case one of the servers goes offline.

## Server Integration

Servers may use this event kind to discover other servers that a user is uploading to in order to download specific blobs from.
